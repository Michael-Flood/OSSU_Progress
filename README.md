Course 1: Berkeley CS 61A (in place of OSSU CS Introduction to Computer Science recommendation), reading Composing Programs by (https://composingprograms.com)

Course 2: EdX "Effective Thinking Through Mathematics"

Course 3: 
  Two part substitution:
    - Read "How To Design Computer Programs, 2nd Edition" (in place of "Program Design" recommendation)
    - MIT 6.005 Software Construction (in place of "Program Design" recommendation)
